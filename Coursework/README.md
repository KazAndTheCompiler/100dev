# 👋 Hey, I’m Kaz

I’m a developer in training (100Devs), learning by building,
breaking things, and then figuring out why the compiler is mad.

### 🧠 What I’m working on
- Full-stack fundamentals
- Small projects with increasing levels of polish
- Writing clearer code than yesterday

### 🛠 Tech I use
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

### 📌 Fun fact
Most bugs disappear after a coffee and a walk.
