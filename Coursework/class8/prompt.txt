Purpose:
Generate 9 independent static header layouts based on 9 provided reference images.
the images are each in a folder: 15_minutes_of_pain, BBC, Hair_Salon, Khan_academy, Level_Ground, Pushwork, Resturant, Source, Tech_Crunch

Scope constraints:
Only HTML and CSS.
No JavaScript.
Only the header section of each site.
No real copy; use lorem ipsum or short placeholder labels.
No responsiveness required unless visible in the reference image.

File structure (repeat per site):

/site-01/index.html

/site-01/style.css
/site-01/normalise.css
(repeat for site-02 through site-09)

HTML rules:

Semantic HTML5 where applicable.

One <header> element per site.

Clear class naming tied to visual structure, not styling.

No inline styles.

Include descriptive HTML comments explaining each structural block.

CSS rules:

Primary layout must use floats.

Float-based layout must be active and functional.

Provide an alternative layout using flexbox or grid, fully written but commented out.

Use a Normalise.css, make the css responsive, make 3 media queries pr site (mobile, tablet and desktop)

Use simple colors and placeholder imagery if needed.

Comments and documentation:

Every major CSS section must include a comment explaining what it controls.

Each layout technique must be clearly labeled (e.g., “Float-based layout – active”, “Flexbox alternative – commented out”).

Explain why floats are used in this layout.

Explain what the alternative layout would change if enabled.

General style rules:

Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

Code should be readable by a beginner revisiting it later.

Assume this is a learning artifact, not production code.

Reference images:

Each site corresponds to one provided image.

Match layout, spacing, and hierarchy visually, not pixel-perfect.

Ignore typography details unless structurally important.

Output expectation:

9 complete header mockups.

Consistent structure across sites where possible.

No missing files, broken links, or placeholders left unresolved.

all 9 folders and images exist in class 8, use the template folder there and copy the normalise.css and reset.css directly, use template style.css as template along with index.html
