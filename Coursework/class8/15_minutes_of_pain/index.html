            <h2>Why Floats Exist</h2>
            <p>
                Floats were originally designed to let text wrap around images.
                Developers later abused them into full layout systems.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!--
            COLUMN 2
            Identical width to column 1.
            Float positioning makes them sit side by side.
        -->
        <section class="column">
            <h2>The Pain</h2>
            <p>
                Floats are removed from normal document flow.
                This causes parent containers to collapse unless cleared.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!--
            COLUMN 3
            The third floated column completes the row.
        -->
        <section class="column">
            <h2>The Lesson</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding floats helps you appreciate why Flexbox
                and Grid were invented later.
