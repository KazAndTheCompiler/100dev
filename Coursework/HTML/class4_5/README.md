# 100Devs – HTML Basics

This repository contains my HTML practice and homework for the **100Devs** program.

## Contents

The files in this repo focus on:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper use of elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `article`
- Recreating site structures such as:
  - BBC
  - Khan Academy
  - TechCrunch
- Understanding how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript responsibilities differ

## Notable Files

- `bbc.html` – BBC homepage structure (HTML only)
- `khan.html` – Khan Academy–style semantic layout
- `techcrunch.html` – News feed structure using articles
- `overlap_mellem_de_3.html` – Exploration of where HTML, CSS, and JS overlap

## Notes

- These files focus on **structure only** (no CSS styling unless explicitly noted).
- This repo is part of my learning process and will evolve over time.
